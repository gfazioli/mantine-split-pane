## Update to v2

> **Note well**
>
> This version of the package is a complete rewrite of the previous version.
> We have rewritten the component to address some limitations of the previous version, particularly with **multiple panes**.
> We have made the `Split.Resizer` component visible and usable so that it can be customized and managed more easily.
> The API has changed, and some props have been removed or modified.
>
> ↓ Follow the instructions below to update your code ↓

### Breaking changes

- Added the new `Split.Resizer` component to manage the resizer between the panes. The `Split.Resizer` component is now a child of the `Split` component and is used to manage the resizing of the panes.
- The `Split` component structure has changed. The `Split` component now needs the `Split.Pane` component as as well as the `Split.Resizer` component.
- The `Split.Pane` component props have changed. We have moved the resizer props to the `Split.Resizer` component. The `Split.Pane` component now only accepts props related to the pane itself.
- The `Split.Pane` `onDoubleClick` prop has been removed. You can now use the `onResetInitialSize` event to manage the double click event. The `onResetInitialSize` event is triggered when the user double clicks on the resizer to reset the initial size of the pane.
- You can still use the `onDoubleClick` prop to manage the double click event in the `Split.Resizer` component.
- The `step` and `shiftStep` props are now accessible both for the `Split` and `Split.Resizer` components. Those props are not accessible for the `Split.Pane` component.

### JSX structure v1

```tsx
<Split>
  <Split.Pane>
    <h1>Pane 1</h1>
  </Split.Pane>

  <Split.Pane>
    <h1>Pane 2</h1>
  </Split.Pane>
</Split>
```

### JSX structure v2

```tsx
<Split>
  <Split.Pane>
    <h1>Pane 1</h1>
  </Split.Pane>

  <Split.Resizer />

  <Split.Pane>
    <h1>Pane 2</h1>
  </Split.Pane>
</Split>
```

- In the `Split.Pane` component all props related to the resizer have been removed. Now you can use the `Split.Resizer` component to manage the resizer between the panes. Have a look at the [Props](/?t=props) section for more information.

## Installation

<InstallScript packages="@gfazioli/mantine-split-pane" />

After installation import package styles at the root of your application:

```tsx
import '@gfazioli/mantine-split-pane/styles.css';
```

You can import styles within a layer `@layer mantine-split-pane` by importing `@gfazioli/mantine-split-pane/styles.layer.css` file.

```tsx title=src/index.tsx highlight={4}
import '@gfazioli/mantine-split-pane/styles.layer.css';
```

## Usage

The main component for creating a Split pane is `Split`, which accepts two or more children, `Split.Pane`. Between each `Split.Pane` you need to add a `Split.Resizer` component. The `Split.Resizer` component is used to manage the resizing of the panes.

<Demo data={demos.configurator} />

> **Note well**
>
> In the example above, the `Paper` component's width and height are set to `100%` to fill the available space. Below are examples without this setting.

## Inline

By default, each `Split` is displayed using `flex`, but in case you want to display the panels inline, you can use the `inline` prop.

<Demo data={demos.inline} />

## Gradient variant

When `variant` prop is set to `gradient`, you can control gradient with `gradient` prop, it accepts an object with `from`, `to` and `deg` properties. If the `gradient` prop is not set, `SplitPaneResizer` will use `theme.defaultGradient` which can be configured on the `theme` object. `gradient` prop is ignored when variant is not gradient.

Note that `variant="gradient"` supports only linear gradients with two colors. If you need a more complex gradient, then use Styles API to modify `SplitPaneResizer` styles.

<Demo data={demos.gradient} />

## Split.Resizer component

Starting from version 2, the `Split.Resizer` component is a child component of `Split` and allows setting some props for the resizer management. It is the component that will be used to resize the panes.

You don't need to set the `Split.Resizer` properties for each resizer, as they inherit these properties from the `Split` component.

In the example below, the first instance shows the `Split.Resizer` component inheriting props from the `Split` component. In contrast, the second instance shows the `Split.Resizer` component with its own props.

<Demo data={demos.resizer} />

### onResizeStart, onResizing, and onResizeEnd events

The `Split.Resizer` provides the same events `onResizeStart`, `onResizing`, and `onResizeEnd` that are [available](#onresizestart-onresizing-and-onresizeend-events-1) in the `Split.Pane`. However, pay attention to the difference in the parameter found in `onResizing` and `onResizeEnd`. In the case of the `Split.Resizer`, the parameter is an object with the properties `width` and `height` for both panes; the one on the left (or top) `beforePane` and the one on the right (or bottom) `afterPane`.

```tsx
export type SPLIT_PANE_RESIZE_SIZES = {
  beforePane: {
    width: number;
    height: number;
  };
  afterPane: {
    width: number;
    height: number;
  };
};
```

The events released are therefore:

```tsx
export interface SplitPaneResizerProps {
  /** Event called when resizer is double clicked */
  onDoubleClick?: (
    event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>
  ) => void;

  /** Event called when pane size starts changing */
  onResizeStart?: () => void;

  /** Event called when pane size changes */
  onResizing?: (sizes: SPLIT_PANE_RESIZE_SIZES) => void;

  /** Event called when pane size changes */
  onResizeEnd?: (sizes: SPLIT_PANE_RESIZE_SIZES) => void;
}
```

<Demo data={demos.resizerEvents} />

## Split.Pane component

The `Split.Pane` component is a child component of `Split` and allows setting some props for panel management. It is the container which will be resized by the `Split.Resizer` component. It's very important because you can set the initial size of the pane, the minimum and maximum size of the pane, and the `grow` property.

<Demo data={demos.pane} />

### initialWidth, initialHeight

The initial size as well as the min and max size of the pane can be set using the `initialWidth`, `initialHeight`, `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `minHeight`, and `maxHeight` props. You may use a numeric value or a string with a unit (px, %) for the size of the pane. The `initialWidth` and `initialHeight` props are used to set the initial size of the pane, while the `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `minHeight`, and `maxHeight` props are used to set the minimum and maximum size of the pane.

<Demo data={demos.initials} />

### minWidth, maxWidth, minHeight, maxHeight

The minimum and maximum sizes of the panes can be set using the `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `minHeight`, and `maxHeight` props. These props allow you to control the resizing behavior of the panes, ensuring they do not shrink or grow beyond specified limits.

<Demo data={demos.max} />

> **Note well**
>
> When resizing the panes, both will adjust simultaneously. This means the maximum and minimum values affect each other. For example, the minimum width of the second panel can impact the maximum width of the first panel. Choose the values carefully.

### grow

The `grow` property is only accessible for `Split.Pane` and enables the panel size to expand and occupy the available space. It is especially handy for establishing a dynamic layout or, as illustrated below, for crafting a layout with two centered panels.

Below the `grow` property is set to `true` for the first pane and `false` for the second pane. The first pane will occupy all the available space, while the second pane will occupy only the space needed for its content.

<Demo data={demos.growFirst} />

Below the `grow` property is set to `true` for the second pane and `false` for the first pane. The second pane will occupy all the available space, while the first pane will occupy only the space needed for its content.

<Demo data={demos.growSecond} />

Below an interesting example of a layout with three panes. The first and third panes are set to `grow={false}` and the second pane is set to `grow={true}`. The second pane will occupy all the available space, while the first and third panes will occupy only the space needed for their content.

<Demo data={demos.growThreePanes} />

Of course, the grow feature can be use also when the orientation is vertical. In the example below, the first pane is set to `grow={false}` and the second pane is set to `grow={true}`. The second pane will occupy all the available space, while the first pane will occupy only the space needed for its content.

<Demo data={demos.growHorizontal} />

> 💡 Suggestions
>
> Try to use the `grow` property with the `initialWidth`, `initialHeight`, `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `minHeight`, and `maxHeight` props to create a dynamic layout.

### onResizeStart, onResizing, and onResizeEnd events

The `Split.Pane` provides the same events `onResizeStart`, `onResizing`, and `onResizeEnd` that are [available](#onresizestart-onresizing-and-onresizeend-events) in the `Split.Resizer`. However, pay attention to the difference in the parameter found in `onResizing` and `onResizeEnd`. In the case of the `Split.Pane`, the parameter is an object with the properties `width` and `height` of the selected pane.

```tsx
export type SPLIT_PANE_SIZE = {
  width: number;
  height: number;
};
```

The events released are therefore:

```tsx
export interface SplitPaneProps {
  /** Event called when pane size starts changing */
  onResizeStart?: () => void;

  /** Event called when pane size changes */
  onResizing?: (size: SPLIT_PANE_SIZE) => void;

  /** Event called when pane size changes */
  onResizeEnd?: (size: SPLIT_PANE_SIZE) => void;

  /** Event called to reset initial size */
  onResetInitialSize?: (
    e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>
  ) => void;
}
```

<Demo data={demos.events} />

## Multiple Panes

You can add as many panes as you want, and you can also set the `minWidth` and `maxWidth` props for each pane along with other props.

<Demo data={demos.multiple} />

## Reset with Double Click

You can reset the size of the panes by double-clicking on the separator.

<Demo data={demos.reset} />

## Custom Double Click

You can also manage double click to swap two different dimensions in rotation. In the example below, double click changes the dimension by alternating the values of the `initialWidth` property.

<Demo data={demos.doubleclick} />

> **Note well**
>
> The `onResetInitialSize` event is triggered when the user double clicks on the resizer to reset the initial size of the pane. You can use this event to manage the double click event in the `Split.Pane` component. The code below shows how to use the `onResetInitialSize` event to manage the double click event in the `Split.Pane` component.
>
> ```tsx
> <Stack>
>   <Text>
>     Double-click on the resizer to swap the initial width of the
>     panes.
>   </Text>
>   <Split>
>     <Split.Pane
>       initialWidth={initialWidth}
>       onResetInitialSize={handleDoubleClick}
>     >
>       <Paper withBorder>
>         <Title>Pane 1</Title>
>       </Paper>
>     </Split.Pane>
>
>     <Split.Resizer />
>
>     <Split.Pane grow>
>       <Paper withBorder>
>         <Title>Pane 2</Title>
>       </Paper>
>     </Split.Pane>
>   </Split>
> </Stack>
> ```
>
> Alternatively, which is the same:
>
> ```tsx
> <Stack>
>   <Text>
>     Double-click on the resizer to swap the initial width of the
>     panes.
>   </Text>
>   <Split>
>     <Split.Pane initialWidth={initialWidth}>
>       <Paper withBorder>
>         <Title>Pane 1</Title>
>       </Paper>
>     </Split.Pane>
>
>     <Split.Resizer />
>
>     <Split.Pane grow onResetInitialSize={handleDoubleClick}>
>       <Paper withBorder>
>         <Title>Pane 2</Title>
>       </Paper>
>     </Split.Pane>
>   </Split>
> </Stack>
> ```

## Nested Split

Naturally, you can nest `Split` components to create more intricate layouts.

<Demo data={demos.nested} />

## Nested Split with different props

Now you can appreciate the flexibility of the `Split` component, which allows you to create complex layouts with different props for each `Split` component.

<Demo data={demos.nestedprops} />

> **Note well**
>
> Remember that you can set the resizer props both on the `Split` component and the `Split.Resizer` component. The `Split.Resizer` component will inherit the props from the `Split` component, but you can override them by setting them on the `Split.Resizer` component.
>
> For example, in the code below, the `Split.Resizer` component will inherit the `spacing` and `radius` prop from the `Split` component.
>
> ```tsx
> <Split orientation="horizontal" radius={256} spacing={16}>
>   <Split.Pane initialHeight={200}>
>     <Paper {...paperProps}>
>       <Title>Pane 2</Title>
>     </Paper>
>   </Split.Pane>
>
>   <Split.Resizer color="red.3" hoverColor="blue.7" size="xl" />
>
>   <Split.Pane initialHeight={300}>
>     <Paper {...paperProps}>
>       <Title>Pane 3</Title>
>     </Paper>
>   </Split.Pane>
> </Split>
> ```
>
> The same with:
>
> ```tsx
> <Split orientation="horizontal">
>   <Split.Pane initialHeight={200}>
>     <Paper {...paperProps}>
>       <Title>Pane 2</Title>
>     </Paper>
>   </Split.Pane>
>
>   <Split.Resizer
>     color="red.3"
>     hoverColor="blue.7"
>     size="xl"
>     radius={256}
>     spacing={16}
>   />
>
>   <Split.Pane initialHeight={300}>
>     <Paper {...paperProps}>
>       <Title>Pane 3</Title>
>     </Paper>
>   </Split.Pane>
> </Split>
> ```

## Store the layout

You can store the layout of the panes and restore it later using the browser `localStorage` or any other storage system.
Try to change the layout and refresh the page to see the layout restored.

<Demo data={demos.store} />

As [previously explained](#onresizestart-onresizing-and-onresizeend-events), you can choose to use events from either the `Split.Pane` or the `Split.Resizer`. Here, the code uses events from the `Split.Pane`, but you can easily use events from the `Split.Resizer` and decide to store a specific pane or both panels.

## Accessibility

You may also use the Keyboard to navigate through the panes. Use the `Tab` key to navigate through the resizer and the <Kbd>Arrow</Kbd> keys to resize the panes. You may use <Kbd>◀︎</Kbd> <Kbd>▶︎</Kbd> for horizontal panes and <Kbd>▼</Kbd> <Kbd>▲</Kbd> for vertical panes.

By default, the `Arrow` keys will resize the panes by `8` pixel, but you can change this value using the `step` prop.
Keeping the <Kbd>SHIFT</Kbd> key pressed while using the `Arrow` keys will resize the panes by `64` pixel, but you can change this value using the `shiftStep` prop.

<Demo data={demos.accessibility} />

> **Note well**
>
> The `step` and `shiftStep` props are accessible both for the `Split` and `Split.Resizer` components. Obviously, the `step` and `shiftStep` props of the `Split.Resizer` component will override the `step` and `shiftStep` props of the `Split` component.
>
> ```tsx
> <Split step={16} shiftStep={128}>
>   <Split.Pane>
>     <h1>Pane 1</h1>
>   </Split.Pane>
>
>   <Split.Resizer step={32} shiftStep={256} />
>
>   <Split.Pane>
>     <h1>Pane 2</h1>
>   </Split.Pane>
>
>   <Split.Resizer />
>
>   <Split.Pane>
>     <h1>Pane 3</h1>
>   </Split.Pane>
> </Split>
> ```
>
> In the above example, the resizer between the **Pane 1** and **Pane 2** will resize the panes by `32` pixel, and the resizer between the **Pane 2** and **Pane 3** will resize the panes by `16` pixel. The `SHIFT` key will resize the panes by `256` pixel between the **Pane 1** and **Pane 2** and by `128` pixel between the **Pane 2** and **Pane 3**.
